When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    Creating a remote repository allow you to work on the go and collaborate your work simutaneously with your friends. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manual pulling is better than automatic pulling because you have control over what branch gets pull and when it is pulled so that you can finish your part without interference from an automatic pull, making changes from under your feet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a special clone on github, clone is simply copying a repository, and branches are used to give one or more commits a name and to separate them from the rest of the changes and commits on the repository.

	Forks, clones, and branches are all ways to add new changes without
    affecting the existing version.  With branches the new changes are added in
    the same repository.  Forking and cloning both copy an entire repository to
    a new location.  The difference between forking and cloning is that forking
    is a special construct made by GitHub.  You can only fork a GitHub
    repository to another location on GitHub, while you can clone any Git
    repository to anywhere you have access to.

    I use branching for most cases where I want to add new changes to a
    repository while keeping an easy reference to a previous version, especially
    when collaborating with other people.  I clone a repository on GitHub when I
    want to work on that repository locally rather than using the GitHub
    website.  I fork a repository on GitHub when I want to make changes to that
    repository public, but I don't have permission to modify the original.

	Fork is when I want to use other people's codes on github while attributing to them. Clone is when I want to download the repo from remote and branch is when I want to work on a new feature or solve a bug without affecting the main production line

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	In case you go offline you can still have the last known state.
	
	One can work on the last known state while offline.
